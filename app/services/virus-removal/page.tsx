          answer:
            "Common signs include unexpected slowdowns, frequent crashes, pop-up ads, browser redirects, unfamiliar programs starting automatically, unusual network activity, or missing files. If you notice any of these symptoms, it's best to have your system checked by professionals.",

          question: "Can you remove ransomware and recover my files?",

            "We can remove the ransomware infection from your system. File recovery depends on the specific ransomware variant and whether you have backups. In some cases, we can use specialized tools to decrypt files, but this isn't always possible. We recommend maintaining regular backups to protect against ransomware.",
